**This file amis to describe data processing code, including data formate, code strcuture and final train/val/test data.**  
There are two data prcocessing codes coming from  **[ASTGCN](https://github.com/guoshnBJTU/ASTGCN-r-pytorch) & [DCRNN](https://github.com/liyaguang/DCRNN)**. 

* ASTGCN  

In PEMS04, raw data's size is (16992,307,3). You can change the number of week/day/hour in XX.conf file. The number of week means how many weeks are choosen, similar with the number of day/hour. The details of dataset are shown in the below pic.

As you can see, the first dimension of raw data is that the collected traffic speed/flow/occupancy.(a data is generated by a sensor in a five-minute interval). 307 represents the number of sensor. For example, if you set the number of week = 1 (other number can also be chosen, in this example, the other parameters is also set to 1), the whole process can be presented by the below pic.

One week's data is 12×24×7 = 2016, one day's data is 24×12 = 288，one hour's data is 1×12 = 12.  

The execution process of the code:  
1. Function: **read_and_generate_dataset()** is used to deal with the several functions and generate the final dataset.  
2. Function: **get_sample_indices()** is used to generate the index of data.  
3. Function: **search_data()** is used to gets the data sample from data_seq by the index of data.  

In the first step, data_seq is made up of sequence_length, num_of_vertices, num_of_features. Cos i set the number of week to 1, data_seq[2016] is the starter. Then, code executes to the second step, the start
